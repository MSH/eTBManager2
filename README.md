##Architecture
In terms of software architecture, e-TB Manager has the following specification:
Database: MySQL 5.6+
Language: Java 1.6+ using JEE 1.5
Application server: JBOSS AS 4.2.3.GA (customized)

##Getting started
Pre requisites
In order to build e-TB Manager from the source code, you will need the following programs installed:
Java JDK 1.6+
Maven 3+
JBOSS 4.2.3.GA, in order to run the application in development side
The version of JBOSS AS in use was customized with some specific libraries, like the MySQL and Hibernate libraries. You may download JBOSS AS used in e-TB Manager from the link http://www.etbmanager.org/download/package/jboss-4.2.3.ga.zip

##Development tools
Any JEE development environment of your choice - Recommended: IntelliJ for development
Installation instructions can be found in the site of each one of these programs.

##Frameworks and libraries
Below is the list of frameworks and libraries used in e-TB Manager.
JPA 1.0 (baked by Hibernate 3.3);
JSF 1.2;
JBOSS SEAM 2.1;
Spring JPA, using Hibernate;
Apache common libs;
Liquibase for automatic database upgrade;

##Client side
jQuery 1.8;
RichFaces 3 (JSF components);
All these frameworks are automatically loaded by Maven, so the list is just a reference.

##Development environment
You need the following tools in order to start development:
Git
Java 1.6+
Maven 3+
MySQL 5.6+
A development environment of your choice (IntelliJ recommended)

##Downloading the source code
The source code is stored in a Git repository.
To download the code, issue the git command.
> git clone xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You will need a user name and password for that.
Inside the repository, there are two main branches: master and development. The master contains the stable version, and should be merged with stable versions achieved in the development branch. So, if you want to change the code, move to the development branch:
> git checkout development
When you finish your changes, perform the following git sequence (as described in the git documentation):
Add all changed files to be committed

> git add .

Commit the changes providing a good description

> git commit -m "description of the changes"

Upload the changes to the remote server

> git push origin development

##Building from the source code
In order to generate a new version of e-TB Manager from the source code, you must issue the following Maven command:
mvn clean package -P production
This will install all necessary dependencies and generate a new version in target/etbmanager-ng.war.

##Configuration file
Before running e-TB Manager, it is necessary to create two configuration files in the <jboss>/server/default/deploy/MSH:
etbmanager-ds.xml - Configure how e-TB Manager will connect to the database;
etbmanager-service.xml - Configure a SMTP server that e-TB Manager will use to dispatch e-mail messages;
There is an example of both files in the /resources folder.

##Running e-TB Manager
In order to run e-TB Manager, just copy the generated file \target\etbmanager.war to the folder
<jboos>/server/default/deploy/MSH
This version of JBOSS supports hot deployment, so you may replace the war file at any time to have it deployed again by JBOSS AS.
