Classes used by the generic version of the system. These classes may be overwritten for an specific workspace.
To overwrite a class, create a component with the same name as the class but with the first char in lower case.
<br/>
Example:
<p/>
If you wish to overwrite class <b>GlobalClass</b> to a workspace with extension <b>ab</b>, create your own class like that: <br/>
<code>
@Name("globalClass_ab")<br/>
public class MySpecificClass { 
</code>
