    * TODO: a hack needed to be done on block 1, 2 and 5 so the query should work, check HAVING clause on queries on the respective classes.
    * About the TO DO above: In SQL I used left join with conditions on the ON clause to select the last exam for cases without treatment and
    * the last exam before treatment to cases with treatment, but in HQL ON clause doesn't exists. There is the WITH clause but in the version of
    * Hibernate that is used in ETBMANAGER it has some bugs.
    * The solution was writing sub queries on the SELECT clause (so the cases that doesn't have a certain exam should not be excluded from the result)
    * and test it on HAVING clause, but another bug of Hibernate happened... Hibernate doesn't recognizes the alias for the subquery result in HQL,
    * so I checked the alias generated on SQL log and putted it on HQL.
    * Summarizing, the alias on HQL is hardcoded to the alias generated in SQL by Hibernate.
